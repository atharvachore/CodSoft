  **CodSoft Python Programming Internship Projects**

Welcome to the repository for the projects I completed as part of the CodSoft Python Programming Internship. Throughout the internship, I developed multiple small yet functional applications to enhance my Python skills. Below is an overview of each project and the features they include.

Projects Overview

1. To-Do List:
   The To-Do List project is a simple command-line application that helps users manage daily tasks by adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.
